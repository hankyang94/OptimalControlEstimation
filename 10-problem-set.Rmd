In this exercise, we will use dynamic programming to solve a geometry problem, i.e., to find the $N$-side polygon inscribed inside a circle with maximum perimeter. We will walk you through the key steps of formulating and solving the problem, while leaving a few mathematical details for you to fill in.

Given a circle with radius $1$, we can randomly choose $N$ distinct points on the circle to form a polygon with $N$ vertices and sides, as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:inscribed-polygon) with $N=3,4,5$.

```{r inscribed-polygon, out.width='80%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Polygons inscribed inside a circle', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/polygon-inside-circle.png')
```

Once the $N$ points are chosen, the $N$-polygon will have a perimeter, i.e., the sum of the lengths of its edges. 

What is the configuration of the $N$ points such that the resulting $N$-polygon has the maximum perimeter? I claim that the answer is when the $N$-polygon has edges of equal lengths, or in other words, when the $N$ points are placed on the circle evenly. 

Let us use dynamic programming to prove the claim.

To use dynamic programming, we need to definie a dynamical system and an objective function.

```{r sequential-placement-N-point, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Sequential placement of N points on the circle.', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/sequential-placement-N-point.png')
```

**Dynamical system**. We will use $\{x_1,\dots,x_N \}$ to denote the angular positions of the $N$ points to be placed on the circle (with slight abuse of notation, we will call each of those points $x_k$ as well). In particular,
as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:sequential-placement-N-point), let us use $x_k$ to denote the angle between the line $O-x_k$ and the vertical line ($O$ is the center of the circle), with zero angle starting at $12$ O'clock and clockwise being positive. Without loss of generality, we assume $x_1 = 0$. (if $x_1$ is nonzero, we can always rotate the entire circle so that $x_1 = 0$). 

After the $k$-th point is placed, we can "control" where the next point $x_{k+1}$ will be, by deciding the incremental angle between $x_{k+1}$ and $x_k$, denoted as $u_k > 0$ in Fig. \@ref(fig:sequential-placement-N-point). This is simply saying the dynamics is
$$
x_{k+1} = x_k + u_k, \quad k=1,\dots,N-1, \quad x_1 = 0.
$$

**Cost-to-go**. The perimeter of the $N$-polygon is therefore
$$
g_N(x_N) + \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} g_k(x_k, u_k),
$$
with the terminal cost
$$
g_N(x_N) = 2 \sin \left(  \frac{2\pi - x_N}{2} \right)
$$
the distance between $x_N$ and $x_1$ (see Fig. \@ref(fig:sequential-placement-N-point)), and the running cost
$$
g_k(x_k,u_k) = 2 \sin \left(  \frac{u_k}{2} \right)
$$
the distance between $x_{k+1}$ and $x_k$. 

**Dynamic programming**. We are now ready to invoke dynamic programming.

We start by setting
$$
J_N(x_N) = g_N(x_N) = 2 \sin \left(  \frac{2\pi - x_N}{2} \right).
$$
We then compute $J_{N-1}(x_{N-1})$ as 
\begin{equation}
J_{N-1}(x_{N-1}) = \max_{0< u_{N-1} < 2\pi - x_{N-1}} \left\{ \underbrace{ 2 \sin \left(  \frac{u_{N-1}}{2} \right) + J_N(x_{N-1} + u_{N-1}) }_{Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1}, u_{N-1})} \right\},
(\#eq:polygon-circle-N-1)
\end{equation}
where $u_{N-1} < 2\pi - x_{N-1}$ because we do not want $x_N$ to cross $2\pi$.

a. Show that
$$
Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1},u_{N-1}) = 2 \sin \left(  \frac{u_{N-1}}{2} \right) + 2 \sin \left(  \frac{2\pi - x_{N-1} - u_{N-1} }{2} \right),
$$
and 
$$
\frac{\partial Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1},u_{N-1})}{\partial u_{N-1}} = \cos \left(  \frac{u_{N-1}}{2} \right) -  \cos \left(  \frac{2\pi - x_{N-1} - u_{N-1} }{2} \right).
$$

b. Show that $Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1},u_{N-1})$ is concave (i.e., $-Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1},u_{N-1})$ is convex) in $u_{N-1}$ for every $x_{N-1} \in (0, \pi)$ and $u_{N-1} \in (0, 2\pi - x_{N-1})$. (Hint: compute the second derivative of $Q_{N-1}(x_{N-1},u_{N-1})$ with respect to $u_{N-1}$ and use Proposition \@ref(prp:decidecvx)).

c. With a and b, show that the optimal $u_{N-1}$ that solves \@ref(eq:polygon-circle-N-1) is
$$
u_{N-1}^\star = \frac{2\pi - x_{N-1}}{2},
$$
and therefore
$$
J_{N-1}(x_{N-1}) = 4 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi - x_{N-1}}{4} \right).
$$
(Hint: the point at which a concave function's gradient vanishes must be the unique maximizer of that function)

d. Now use induction to show that the $k$-th step dynamic programming
$$
J_k(x_k) = \max_{0< u_k < 2\pi - x_k} \left\{ 2 \sin\left( \frac{u_k}{2} \right) + J_{k+1}(x_k + u_k) \right\}
$$
admits an optimal control
$$
u_k^\star = \frac{2\pi - x_k}{N-k+1},
$$
and optimal cost-to-go
$$
J_k(x_k) = 2(N-k+1)\sin\left( \frac{2\pi - x_k}{2(N-k+1)} \right).
$$

e. Starting from $x_1 = 0$, what is the optimal sequence of controls? 

Hopefully now you see why my original claim is true!

**(Bonus)** We are not yet done for this exercise. Since you have probably already spent quite some time on this exercise, I will leave the rest of the exercise a bonus. In case you found this simple geometric problem interesting, you should keep reading as we will use numerical techniques to prove the same claim.

In Fig. \@ref(fig:sequential-placement-N-point), by denoting 
$$
u_N = 2\pi - x_N = 2\pi - (u_1 + \dots + u_{N-1})
$$
as the angle between the line $O-x_{N}$ and the line $O-x_1$, it is not hard to observe that the perimeter of the $N$-polygon is 
$$
\sum_{k=1}^N 2 \sin \left( \frac{u_k}{2} \right).
$$
Consequently, to maximize the perimeter, we can formulate the following optimization
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\max_{u_1,\dots,u_N} &\quad \sum_{k=1}^N 2 \sin \left( \frac{u_k}{2} \right) \\
\text{subject to} &\quad u_k > 0, k=1,\dots,N \\
&\quad u_1 + \dots + u_N = 2 \pi
\end{split}
(\#eq:polygon-circle-convexoptmization)
\end{equation}
where $u_k$ can be seen as the angle spanned by the line $x_k - x_{k+1}$ with respect to the center $O$ so that they are positive and sum up to $2\pi$.

f. Show that the optimization \@ref(eq:polygon-circle-convexoptmization) is convex. (Hint: first show the feasible set is convex, and then show the objective function is concave over the feasible set.)

Now that we have shown \@ref(eq:polygon-circle-convexoptmization) is a convex optimization problem, we know that pretty much any numerical algorithm will guarantee convergence to the globally optimal solution.

It is too much to ask you to implement a numerical algorithm on your own, as that can be a one-semester graduate-level course [@nocedal99book-numerical]. However, Matlab provides a nice interface, [`fmincon`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html), to many such numerical algorithms, and let me show you how to use `fmincon` to solve \@ref(eq:polygon-circle-convexoptmization) so we can numerically prove our claim.

g. I have provided most of the code necessary for solving \@ref(eq:polygon-circle-convexoptmization) below. Please fill in the definition of the function `perimeter(u)`, and then run the code in Matlab. Show your results for $N=3,10,100$. Do the solutions obtained from `fmincon` verify our claim?

```matlab
clc; clear; close all;
% number of points to be placed
N = 10;
% define the objective function
% fmincon assumes minimization
% We minimize the negative perimeter so as to maximize the perimeter
objective = @(u) -1*perimeter(u);
% choose which algorithm to use for solving
options = optimoptions('fmincon', 'Algorithm', 'interior-point');
% supply an initial guess
% since this is a convex problem, we can use any initial guess
u0 = rand(N,1);
% solve
uopt = fmincon(objective,u0,... % objective and initial guess
    -eye(N),zeros(N,1),... % linear inequality constraints
    ones(1,N),2*pi,... % linear equality constraints
    [],[],[],... % we do not have lower/upper bounds and nonlinear constraints
    options);

% plot the solution
x = zeros(N,1);
for k = 2:N
    x(k) = x(k-1) + uopt(k-1);
end
figure;
% plot a circle
viscircles([0,0],1);
hold on
% scatter the placed points
scatter(cos(x),sin(x),'blue','filled');
axis equal;

%% helper functions
% The objective function
function f = perimeter(u)
% TODO: define the perimeter function here.
end
```

Consider a variant of the LQR problem \@ref(eq:lqr-formulation) where the controls are bounded between $[-u_{\max}, u_{\max}]$, the system matrices $A_k, B_k$ are constant, and the dynamics is deterministic:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
J(x_0) = \min_{u_{0},\dots,u_{N-1} \in [-u_{\max},u_{\max}]} &\quad  x_N^T Q_N x_N + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (x_k^T Q_k x_k + u_k^T R_k u_k) \\
\text{subject to} &\quad  x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k,  k=0,\dots,N-1
\end{split}
(\#eq:lqr-constraints)
\end{equation}
We assume $Q_k\succeq 0$ for $k=0,\dots,N$ and $R_k \succ 0$ for all $k=0,\dots,N-1$.

a. Show that Problem \@ref(eq:lqr-constraints), when $x_0$ is given, is a convex optimization problem.

b. Discretize the continuous-time double integrator dynamics
$$
\ddot{q} = u, \quad u \in [-1,1]
$$
in the form of $x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k$ with a constant $dt$ time discretization. (Hint: take $x = [q,\dot{q}]$ as the state vector.)

c. Fix $N=50$, $dt=0.1$ and choose your favorite $Q_k$ and $R_k$. Solve the convex optimization \@ref(eq:lqr-constraints) at a dense grid of $x_0$. Plot $J(x_0)$. (Hint: you will most likely benefit from Appendix \@ref(appconvex-practice).)

d. Increase $N$ and decrease $dt$, plot $J(x_0)$ for different pairs of $(N,dt)$. What do you observe?

e. (Bonus) Can you write down the KKT optimality conditions of \@ref(eq:lqr-constraints) and explain what you have observed from the numerical experiment? (Hint: KKT optimality conditions can be found in Theorem \@ref(thm:KKT).)
