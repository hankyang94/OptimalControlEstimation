Remark (Deterministic v.s. Stochastic). When \\(w_k \\equiv 0\\) for all \\(k\\), we say the system (1.1) is deterministic; otherwise we say the system is stochastic. In the following we will deal with the stochastic case, but most of the methodology should carry over to the deterministic setup. We consider the class of controllers (also called policies) that consist of a sequence of functions \\[ \\pi = \\{ \\mu_0,\\dots,\\mu_{N-1} \\}, \\] where \\(\\mu_k (x_k) \\in \\mathbb{U}\\) for all \\(x_k\\), i.e., \\(\\mu_k\\) is a feedback controller that maps the state to an admissible control. Given an initial state \\(x_0\\) and an admissible policy \\(\\pi\\), the state trajectory of the system is a sequence of random variables that evolve according to \\[\\begin{equation} x_{k+1} = f_k(x_k,\\mu_k(x_k),w_k), \\quad k=0,\\dots,N-1 \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] where the randomness comes from the disturbance \\(w_k\\). We assume the state-control trajectory \\(\\{u_k\\}_{k=0}^{N-1}\\) and \\(\\{x_k \\}_{k=0}^{N}\\) induce an additive cost \\[\\begin{equation} g_N(x_N) + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} g_k(x_k,u_k) \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(g_k,k=0,\\dots,N\\) are some user-designed functions. With (1.2) and (1.3), for any admissible policy \\(\\pi\\), we denote its induced expected cost with initial state \\(x_0\\) as \\[ J_\\pi (x_0) = \\mathbb{E} \\left\\{ g_N(x_N) + \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} g_k (x_k, \\mu_k(x_k)) \\right\\}, \\] where the expectation is taken over the randomness of \\(w_k\\).
