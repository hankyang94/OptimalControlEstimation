# Stability Analysis {#stability}

::: {.lemma #Barbalat name="Barbalat's Lemma"}
Let $f(t)$ be differentiable, if 

- $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} f(t)$ is finite, and  

- $\dot{f}(t)$ is uniformly continuous,^[A sufficient condition for this to hold is that $\ddot{f}$ exists and is bounded.]

then 
$$
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \dot{f}(t) = 0.
$$

::: {.theorem #BarbalatStability name="Barbalat's Stability Certificate"}
If a scalar function $V(x,t)$ satisfies

- $V(x,t)$ is lower bounded,

- $\dot{V}(x,t)$ is negative semidefinite 

- $\dot{V}(x,t)$ is uniformly continuous

then $\dot{V}(x,t) \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.

::: {.proof}
$V(x,t)$ is lower bounded and $\dot{V}$ is negative semidefinite implies the limit of $V$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$ is finite (note that $V(x,t) \leq V(x(0),0)$). Then the theorem clearly follows from Barbalat's Lemma \@ref(lem:Barbalat).
